// Scheduled garbage-collection for orphaned form file-answer uploads.
//
// A "file" answer is uploaded to the private "form-uploads" bucket the moment the
// student picks it — BEFORE they submit. The student form deletes the object again
// on every deterministic exit (remove, replace, modal close, rejected submit), so
// the only orphans left are the ones a *crash* stranded: the browser was killed
// (tab closed, laptop died, reload) after the upload but before submit, so the
// cleanup code never ran. Nothing on the server references those files, so without
// this sweep they would live in the bucket forever against the free-tier cap.
//
// The sweep is deliberately conservative: it deletes an object ONLY when ALL hold:
//   1. its name is an app-minted key ("<uuid>.<ext>") — never touches anything else,
//   2. no submission anywhere references it, and
//   3. it is older than MIN_AGE_MS — so a file a student uploaded and is about to
//      submit (an active, not-yet-saved session) is never swept out from under them.
