/**
 * Lightweight polling hook used in place of a websocket/SSE real-time layer.
 *
 * Why polling: on the Supabase free tier, Realtime is capped at 200 concurrent
 * connections — a single busy event could exceed that with student devices alone.
 * Polling has no connection cap, needs no extra infrastructure, and costs $0 on
 * Vercel Hobby + Supabase free.
 *
 * Free-tier friendly behaviour:
 *  - Fires `callback` immediately on mount (when the tab is visible) and again
 *    each time the tab regains focus, so data is fresh the moment the user looks.
 *  - Polls every `intervalMs` only while the tab is visible.
 *  - Pauses entirely when the tab is hidden, so idle background tabs don't burn
 *    function invocations or database queries.
 *
 * Overlap-safe (this is the important part for the DB pooler): the next tick is
 * scheduled only AFTER the current one settles, and a tick is skipped while one is
 * still in flight. With the old setInterval, a single slow response (e.g. the
 * pooler momentarily queueing a connection) caused requests to STACK — every
 * `intervalMs` fired another, each opening its own pooled connections, which piled
 * load onto the very pooler that was already struggling and turned one slow request
 * into a site-wide wave of 504s. Awaiting each tick caps every tab at exactly one
 * in-flight request, so polling load stays flat no matter how slow the backend is.
 *
 * A request that overruns is also aborted via the AbortSignal handed to the
 * callback (pass it to `fetch`), so a stalled request is dropped — and its
 * connection released — instead of being held until the platform 504s it.
 *
 * The callback is read from a ref, so passing a fresh inline function each render
 * is fine — the loop always invokes the latest version without restarting.
